# Git usage guidelines
## Aim of this document
Given that many people in this team are using GitHub to manage a project for the first time, we believe that providing some guidelines is necessary. We will focus on explaining the group collaboration features of GitHub, including branches and pull requests. Lastly, we will provide a step-by-step guide on performing a task from proposal to completion. 


## Branches
### Explanation
Branches in Git are basically the separate lines of development. They allow you to work on different features, bug fixes, and other experiments without affecting the main codebase.
### Usage
When working on a task in github, you should create a new branch from the main branch. This new branch serves as an isolated environment where you can make changes. As one of your branch versions is ready to be reviewed, you can pull requests for merging your own branch back into the main branch.


## Pull Requests
### Explanation 
This function is aimed to tell other team members about changes you've pushed to your branch, open a platform for you all to discuss and review the changes, and request for merging your branch into the main branch.
### Usage
After you've made changes on a branch and are ready to incorporate them into the main codebase, you create a pull request. Other team members can review the changes, leave comments, and suggest modifications if needed. Once the changes are approved and any necessary discussions are resolved, the main branch would be updated.


## A guide on implementing a task

#### Create a draft of task on "Projects" page
#### Add yourself as one of the Assignees
#### Convert your assigned draft into a issue
#### Create a New Branch on the Issue Page
#### Edit the Branch locally or on GitHub
#### Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages
#### Create a new Pull Request on "Branches" page
#### Click on the banner suggesting to "Compare & pull request" for the branch
#### Review, Discuss, and modify the changes with team members
#### Merge Pull Request on "Pull request" page after been approved
